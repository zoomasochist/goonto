† = "Linux support" means X11. Wayland does not allow programs to control the position
of their windows, so Goonto etc. will never work.
\* = Unlikely to be implemented. Presume everything else
marked ❌ is in the pipeline.

## Issues

- Not multi-monitor aware
    - Should be pretty simple to implement

## Building

- Install wxWidgets and nlohmann_json
- `make`
- ???
- Profit!!!
